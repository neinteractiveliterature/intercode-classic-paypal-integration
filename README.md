# intercode-classic-paypal-integration
The PayPal IPN listener used by [Intercode 1](https://github.com/neinteractiveliterature/intercode-classic)

This is the way we used to handle convention and T-shirt payments for Intercode 1 sites.  If you have multiple Intercode 1 installations, perhaps it will also be useful for you.
